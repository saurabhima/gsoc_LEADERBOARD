# **SphinxCAPT.org LEADERBOARD**
### Overview
In this project we are designing a FLASK based Web App to maintain Leaderboards for [SphinxCAPT.org](http://SphinxCAPT.org).
The app is based on the REST design with inherent security infrastructure. This project is being maintained as part of the Google Summer of Code 2017.
### Background
This project was envisaged in order to provide developers and volunteers with a one-stop- solution for managing and tracking donations and details of prospective donors for the SphinxCapt project at CMU. The project included a leaderboard of Donor, which is our special way of thanking donors who are supporting the project. The project also provides a workflow to the project members and volunteers to log telephonic and email correspondence with all donors. 
### Requirements
* **Backend**
    * Python 3
    * Flask
    * Pickle
* **Frontend**
    * Web Browser with HTML5
    * Javascript

### Installation
* **Install Python 2.7** - In case Python 2.7 is not already installed on your computer you need to install it. You can refer to these tutorial videos for help.
    * Windows Install 
    
    [![Python 2.7 Windows Install](https://img.youtube.com/vi/QYUBz4mrnFU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYUBz4mrnFU)
    
    * Ubuntu Install
    
        Python 2.7 is installed by default in case of Ubuntu. If you are using some other flavour of Debian or a minimal install version then you need to install Python 2.7 seperately. You can also confirm the default Python version using the following command
        > python -V
       
       In case you cannot find Python 2.7 on your PC, you can use the following video tutorial to install.

    * Virtual Environment Install - In case you wish to execute the code in a Python Virtual Environment (VirtualEnv) you can use the tutorial below.
     
        [Python Virtual Environment Tutorial](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
* **Package Install** - The required Python packages can be installed using the following commands
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
### Execution
The Donor Management Workflow Flask application can be executed by the following command
 > python leaderboard.py

The python interpreter will respond with the IP and Port on which the Flask app is running

Eg
> Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

The user can then use this web address to open the default page or index.html
## Donor Leaderboard
 The Donor Leaderboard gives the details of all donors who have helped support this project through donations. These donations are used to buy Amazon Mechanical Turk Credits for the project. The Donor Leaderboard lists donors as per their donated amount. It also provides the facility to maintain anonymity of donors (if they wish to) as well as search for donors using various search criteria. In future we wish to make this leaderboard more interesting.
## Donor Management Workflow
This module will provide the various types of users to access sub modules which will help them in managing donors across various stages of the donation process. 
The Workflow diagram below gives the gist of the whole process.

The various stages are mentioned in details below.
### User Types
 * **Administrator** - This type of user is basically for overall management of the user group and the backend functionality. The Administration module of the index page is only visible to this kind of user
 * **Supervisor** - This type of user has rights to add and modify donor details and contacts and also freeze the donation amount and payment method and generate reciept for the same. Additional funcionalities can be added at a later stage.
 * **Volunteer** - This type of user has access to details of various prospective donors with contact details but can only perform mailing and phone contact logging. Other roles can also be added to this account type at a later stage.
### Work Flow Sub  Modules
The Donor Management workflow System has the following sub modules which are accessible to specific user types who can use these modules to manage the prospective donors at various stages of the donation process
* **Administration**
    * **User Registration Sub Module** - Allows new users to register for various roles subject to approval by a administrator account.This module is accessible by default.
    * **User Login** - Allows registered and approved users to login.
    * **Delete User** - Allows Administrator to Suspend or Delete an existing user account.

* **Donor Leader Board** - This module is visible by default and allows everyone to track the various donors who have committed and freezed the donation to the project. Only certian details of the donor are visible. In case the donor wished to remain anonymous, this facility could be added while commiting the donation amount.

* **Donor Management** - This sub modules allows the various authorized users to perform the following roles
    * Add Prospective Donors
    * Update Donor Contact
    * Donor Phone Contact Logging
    * Donor Mailing
    * Donation Commit and Receipt
    * Accounts
### Directory Structure
The project follows the standard Flask Directory Structure. The detailed directory structure is being updated and would be posted soon.
### Database
~~This project is currently using Pickle files to store data related to both donors as well as workflow users. The name of the files are mentioned in the config.py file under the following variables~~

* ~~User Account Database - USER_DETAILS_PICKLE_FILE~~
* ~~Donor Details Database - DONOR_DETAILS_PICKLE_FILE~~

~~The database would be migarted to a conventional SQL DBMS platform in the future.~~

The database has been migrated from a pickle file storage system to a MySQL Database. The Schema for the database is given below for reference.
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saurabhima/gsoc_LEADERBOARD/Change_DB_MYSQL/Schema.png)

__Database Name:__ donorworkflow

However the function reference as well as pickle files from the previous database implementation have been kept intact for backward compatibility in commented mode. The name of called methods remain same for both types of database implementation.
### Flask Endpoint Description
  This section provides an overview of all the endpoints available to users in the Donor Management Workflow
  * __/__ - This module will launch index.html and give the default view of the application
  * __/default__ - This endpoint is only for testing purpose to check redirecting of webpages
  * __/donorleaderboard__ - This endpoint will launch the ___donor_leaderboard.html___ webpage which displays the current Donor Leaderboard to all users
  
  * __User Management Endpoints__
    
    * __/user_register__ - This endpoint is used for registering new users and launches ___register_new_user.html___
    * __/process_new_user_register__ - This endpoint collects the POST response from  ___/user_register___ endpoint and extracts user credentials like email address, phone, name, username, password etc and stores it in the User Account Database. After this the user is redirected to ___index.html___
    * __/user_login__ - This endpoint is used for logging existing and approved users and launches ___user_login.html___
    * __/user_login_process__ - This endpoint collects the POST response from  ___/user_login___ endpoint and extracts user credentials like username and password and matches it with credentials stored in the User Account Database. On matching the user status is changed to ___Logged___ and user is redirected to ___index.html___. In case of failed login the user is directed to the ___Login Error Page___ i.e. ___invalid_login.html___
    * __/logout__ - This endpoint deletes the user login session variables and updates the status to Not Logged. The user is then redirected to ___index.html___
    * __/approve_new_user__ - This endpoint is only available to ___Administrator___ User Group and allows these users to approve pending users who have freshly registered. This endpoint launches ___approve_user.html___. In case these is no user account pending for approval, the user is redirected to ___index.html___
    * __/approve_new_user_process__ - This endpoint collects the POST response from  ___/approve_new_user___ endpoint and extracts user credentials like email address, phone, name, username etc. In case the user is approved by the Administrator the account status is changed to ___Active___. In case the administrator rejects the user account, the same is removed from the list of pending users.
  
  * __Donor Management Endpoints__
    
    * __/register_new_donor__ - This endpoint is used by authorized users to add details of prospective donors to the ___Donor Details Database___ which would be further used in the workflow during the whole donor management process
    * __/process_donor_form__ - This endpoint collects the POST response from  ___/register_new_donor___ endpoint and extracts Donor user credentials like email address, phone, name, organisation etc and stores it in the Donor Details Database
    * __/donor_contact_update__ - This endpoint launches ___donor_contact_update.html___ and used to update contact details of registered donors. The user can choose the specific donor by searching for the donor from the list and update the contact information
    * __/donor_contact_update_process__ - This endpoint extract the ___Donor ID___ selected by the user for updating contact information in the ___/donor_contact_update___ endpoint and passes this ID to ___donor_contact_update_form.html___ where it is read by Jinja for displaying the available contact info about the donor
    * __/donor_contact_update_form_process__ - This endpoint collects the POST response from  ___/donor_contact_update_process___ endpoint and extracts the updated Donor contact info like email address and phone and updates it in the Donor Details Database
    * __/donor_phone_contact__ - This endpoint lauches ___donor_phone_contact.html___ which is used to select the donor with whom the user wants to log the telephonic conversation. The user can select the target donor from the Donor List and using form submission this information is passed to the ___/donor_phone_contact_process___ endpoint
    * __/donor_phone_contact_process__ - This endpoint collects the POST response from  ___/donor_phone_contact___ endpoint and extracts Donor ID. Then is searches the Donor ID in the Donor Details Database to extract other credential of the user. Details of previous conversations with the donor are also retrieved. The endpoint further passes this information to ___donor_phone_contact_logging.html___
    * __/donor_phone_log_process__ - This endpoint collects POST response from ___donor_phone_contact_logging.html___. These details include summary of the telephonic conversartion with the donor as well as details shared with the donor. These details are updated in the __DONOR_CONTACT_LOGS_FILE___
